# 🩺 Diabetes Risk Prediction using Machine Learning  

A machine learning project that predicts whether a person is at **high risk** or **low risk** of diabetes, based on basic medical parameters such as Glucose, BMI, Blood Pressure, and more.  
Built using Python, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy, and Jupyter Notebook.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Early detection of diabetes can help individuals take timely action and prevent serious health complications.  
This project uses the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset** to train a classification model (Logistic Regression) that predicts diabetes risk.

The project includes:

- Data loading & preprocessing  
- Feature scaling  
- Model training & evaluation  
- Saving trained model as `.pkl`  
- A CLI-based prediction system (`predict.py`)  
- Organized, modular project structure  

This project fulfills the structure and documentation requirements given by VIT faculty.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Flow

1. Load raw dataset  
2. Clean & preprocess data  
3. Split into train/test  
4. Scale features  
5. Train Logistic Regression model  
6. Evaluate using accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report  
7. Save model + scaler  
8. Predict using user input (CLI program)
